                <strong>The property crisis is over!</strong><br>
                Housing for everyone!<br>
                The country has successfully converted all our tall ugly concrete buildings to<br>
                wooden houses and green parks! No more cranes and blocked views!<br>
                Let's hope things stay that way...<br>
                <br>
                ... That's where you come in.<br>
                In a country full of houses and unused space you see...<br>
                <strong>Potential...</strong><br>
                <strong>Your goal:</strong> Build apartments, as these generate money!<br>
                With that money, you can build more apartments, to earn even more!<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Good luck!</strong>
